Here at Selexera, we provide unblockable games, unblockable apps and more!

This is the beginning of a new bypassing era!

--How to access file-site--

click the green code dropdown button on the top right of the screen

on the bottom of the dropdown click download zip

open zip and open folder

open all of the cookie folders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and put them in 1 folder named "cookie"

open the cookie folder and combine all of the img folders into one folder named "img"

open madalin folders 1, and 2 and put then in one folder named "madalinstuntcars"

double click and open the index.html file NOTE: try to use chrome because it is the best browser for accessing the file-site


!IMPORTANT!
Be sure to do step 5, 6, and 7 in the how to access file-site, or cookie clicker and/or Madalin stunt cars will not work!



--How to access data-site--

soon




At Selexera, we provide a wide variety of games, apps, Links, links for other proxies, link to other game sites, other cool bypass stuff, and settings such as an about blank cloak, different cloaks such as a title changer, and themes.

Please note that we know that we are far from done and there will be a whole bunch of new stuff added to the file-site/data-site.

Stuff that we want to add: A search engine [D-A] (I'm pretty sure that once we have the search engine,you wont be able to access the search engine through the file-site nor the data-site. I don't know completely so don't be so sad yet)

More games [D-A]

More apps [D-A]

A link, and the ability to deploy your own links [D-A]

A discord server [D-A]

Meanings D-A = definitely adding

P-A = Probably adding
